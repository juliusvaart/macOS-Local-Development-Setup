# macOS Local Development Setup

After my MAMP PRO setup became very unstable I decided to setup my local development environment different.

I used various tips and recources from developer colleaugues.

I now run Apache, PHP (multiple versions: 5.6, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0 and 8.1) and MariaDB locally on macOS extended with Zend OPcache, APCu Cache and XDebug.

This is the setup I used:
